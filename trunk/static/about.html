<h4>There are some exceptions but <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&ctx=basics&hl=en#case">Google search results basically are NOT case sensiteve.</a></h4>


<div>
<a href="http://case-sensitive-search.appspot.com/">This application</a> will Google query terms (the first input box), scan through the results in a specific range (From:From+Limit) and filter out those results where the filter terms (second input box; if empty, then same as the query terms) does not appear exactly in the same case as given by the user. 
<br/> 
Support for <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&amp;ctx=basics&amp;hl=en#phrases">phrase search (quotes)</a> has been added but no other <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&amp;ctx=advanced">advanced</a> search option is supported like <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&amp;ctx=basics&amp;hl=en#negative">negative terms</a>, etc. 
<br/> 
If you want to use advanced search options then type your advanced Google query in the upper box and use the second input box to provide case sensitive filter terms. <a href="../search?q=%22Rose+Bush%22+site%3Afacebook.com&btn=Start&f=%22Rose+Bush%22&s=0">Example</a>

<div>The user can set the maximum number of Google results that will be scanned through in the "Limit" drop down box. This is an upper limit for the depth of a search and it's maximum value is 1000: Sorry, Google does not serve more than 1000 results for any query. Actually the search will stop when 10 case-matching results have been found. The user can click on the "Next" button to get the next page (continue with scaning through the Google results).</div>
