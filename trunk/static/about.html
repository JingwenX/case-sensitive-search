<a href="http://case-sensitive-search.appspot.com/">This application</a> will google basic terms, scan through the results and filter out results of different case than the search terms. <br/> Support for <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&amp;ctx=basics&amp;hl=en#phrases">phrase search (quotes)</a> has been recently added but no other <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&amp;ctx=advanced">advanced</a> search option is supported like <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&amp;ctx=basics&amp;hl=en#negative">negative terms</a>, etc. <br/> If you want to use advanced search options then you may use the second input box to provide filter terms without the advanced options.
</div>
<br/>
<div>The initial intention was to create an application which would run a query for a longer period and the client would poll for new results in every few seconds. As the app engine <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sandbox.html">can not spwan sub process</a> the client has to wait until the query is finished and won't get any results until that. Also, the user can set the maximum number of results that will be returned and the maximum number of Google results that will be scanned through.</div>
